 a huge ball of gases. It has a diameter of 1
 ,392,000 km. It is so huge that it can hold
 millions of planets inside it. The Sun is 
 mainly made up of hydrogen and helium gas.
 The surface of the Sun is known as the 
 photosphere. The photosphere is surrounded
 by a thin layer of gas known as the
 chromospheres. Without the Sun, there
 would be no life on Earth. There would
 be no plants, no animals and no human 
 beings. As, all the living things on Earth
 get their energy from
 the Sun for their survival.<a href=

<p>Write short paragraphs
Write short paragraphs and cover one topic per paragraph. Long paragraphs discourage users 
from even trying to understand your material. Short paragraphs are easier to read and understand.

Writing 
experts
 recommend
 paragraphs of no more than 150
 words in three to eight sentences. 
 Paragraphs should never be longer
 than 250 words. Vary the lengths of 
 your paragraphs to make them more interesting. 
 As with sentence length, if all paragraphs are
 the same size your writing will be choppy.

There is 
nothing wrong with an occasional 
one-sentence paragraph.

Using short
 paragraphs is an ideal way to open 
 up your writing and create white space.
 In turn, this makes your writing more 
 inviting and easier to read.

Along with 
breaking material
 up into shorter paragraphs, c
 onsider adding headings for each
 paragraph as we did in the following e
 
 xample.
